Comment:

I've been trying to make a video game. It's pretty rough around the edges right now. Character sprites don't always cooperate, one of the character classes can't even attack yet, but I'm pretty proud of it so far. I made it using Unity, a starter package called uMMORPG, and a bunch of assets from the public domain.

It's really difficult, but I'm sure a hacker such as yourself won't have any problem figuring it out. ;)

The flag for this challenge can be obtained by winning the coridoor race.

For the 1st Pwntown challenge you did not neet to hack, you simply needed to go to the top-left side of the map and start the race, then you could simply run down the rest of the left side and win.
